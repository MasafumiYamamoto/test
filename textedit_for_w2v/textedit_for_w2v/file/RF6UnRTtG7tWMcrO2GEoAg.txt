unfortunately the frustration of being dr goldbergs patient is a repeat of the experience ive had with so many other doctors in nyc -- good doctor terrible staff  it seems that his staff simply never answers the phone  it usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer  who has time for that or wants to deal with it  i have run into this problem with many other doctors and i just dont get it  you have office workers you have patients with medical needs why isnt anyone answering the phone  its incomprehensible and not work the aggravation  its with regret that i feel that i have to give dr goldberg 2 stars
